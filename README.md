# python-projects
This repository contains my guess that word simulator game and my currency converter. Both are created in python. The simulator plays music and files the names of the players. 

The code (in other files in this repository) contains how each project works. 

The Guess that word simulator:
- User inputs their name and is allowed to guess a word, guess a letter, or ask to see the amount of letters in the word. 
- This process continues until the user guesses the word correctly. The words will be from a file in the project (sourcewords).

The Currency converter:
- This project converts currency amounts between currencies like yen, American dollars, and others. 

These are all of the python projects in this repository.
